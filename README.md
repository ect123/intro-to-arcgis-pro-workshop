#### Download Workshop Data
To get started with this workshop, you'll need to first download the data and files :exclamation: here :exclamation:. Save this file (.**zip**) to your Desktop.
1. Right-click on the .zip file you just downloaded and select **Extract All**...
2. Accept all defaults to extract the file.    

Open the new **Intro-to-ArcGIS-Pro** folder. This is your project folder which contains the files:
- Intro.**gdb**: the geodatabase with data for your map
- Intro.**aprx**: the project file with all the maps
- Intro.**tbx**: a toolbox with analytical tools for your project
- Index: folder with background organizing information

## USER INTERFACE
ArcGIS Pro is the latest desktop GIS software from the software company Esri. This software must be purchased, downloaded, installed, and configured on your computer for it to work as intended. Those of you at the University of British Columbia can find more information about the availability of ArcGIS Pro software :exclamation: here :exclamation:.

Open the software and get familiar with the default user interface.
1. In Windows, go to the Programs menu and find the ArcGIS Program Group, then select ArcGIS Pro.
2. In the dialog window, click on **Create a New Project > Blank**. This will create a new project file (**.aprx**), and open the ArcGIS Pro main user interface.
3. In the new dialog window, click ok to accept the defaults and finish creating your new project.

You should see something like this:

#### Main Components
The ArcGIS Pro user interface (UI) has a few main components:
- The **Map Frame**: This is where your data will be visualized.
- The **Contents Pane**: This will likely be your most used "tabbed" window because it's where you'll interact with your data. As you add data to your project, they'l appear here as **layers**.
- The **Catalogue Pane**: This pane is similar to Windows Explorer, or Mac Finder. You can create connections to data sources (drives, folders, networks, etc.) and perform several data maintenance and management tasks in this pane. The search option is also available here, which is used to search for tools, documents, and data.
- **Menu Tabs**: These are located at the top of the main UI
